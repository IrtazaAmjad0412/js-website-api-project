# PokéHub

PokéHub is a simple, responsive web application that lets users browse a selection of 30 Pokémon, view their detailed stats and abilities, and manage their favorite Pokémon. The app uses the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data and stores favorites locally in the browser.
